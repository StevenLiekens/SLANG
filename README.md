Txt (t…õkst) is a collection of code that provides a foundation for text parsers.

This repository contains two libraries: 
* Txt.Core
* Txt.ABNF

Txt is still under active development. Pre-release versions are available on MyGet. 

# Package: Txt (previously TextFx)

All structured languages have one thing in common: each language has a formal syntax specification that describes the grammar rules for that language. Programmers use these grammar rules to create programs that parse the language.

The Txt code library assists you with creating parsers for any given language. You create your own tokens and token parsers by deriving from classes in this library.

Syntax specifications are most commonly defined in a flavor of BNF (Backus-Naur Form). Txt provides an implementation of ABNF (Augmented BNF). The ABNF specification defines a set of core grammar rules that are in common use.

```
ALPHA          =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z

BIT            =  "0" / "1"

CHAR           =  %x01-7F
                       ; any 7-bit US-ASCII character,
                       ;  excluding NUL

CR             =  %x0D

                       ; " (Double Quote)

HTAB           =  %x09
                       ; horizontal tab

                       ; Use of this linear-white-space rule
                       ;  permits lines containing only white

                       ;  headers and use with caution in

Custom syntax specifications can define rules that build upon these core rules.


## How to use the code

Building a parser using Txt begins with defining a text source. A text source can be any class that implements `ITextSource` and `IDisposable`.

Txt includes `ITextSource` implementations for `System.String` or `System.IO.Stream`.

A text source object is passed to a text scanner, which provides methods for reading and matching character data. A text scanner can be any class that implements `ITextScanner` and `IDisposable`.

Txt includes a `TextScanner` class that is intended to fullfill every need.

A text scanner is passed to a lexer, which reads grammar elements from the text source and converts them to `Element` objects. A lexer can be any class that implements `ILexer<T>`.

Txt includes an abstract `Lexer` class that you should derive from.

StringTextSource example:
```c#
string input = "123";
using (ITextSource textSource = new StringTextSource(input))
using (ITextScanner textScanner = new TextScanner(textSource))
{
    ILexer<Integer> integerLexer = new IntegerLexer(...);
    ReadResult<Integer> readResult = integerLexer.Read(textScanner);
}
```
StreamTextSource:
```c#
using (Stream fileStream = File.OpenRead("input.txt"))
using (PushbackInputStream inputStream = new PushbackInputStream(fileStream))
using (ITextSource textSource = new StreamTextSource(inputStream, Encoding.UTF8))
using (ITextScanner textScanner = new TextScanner(textSource))
{
    ILexer<Integer> integerLexer = new IntegerLexer(...);
    ReadResult<Integer> readResult = integerLexer.Read(textScanner);
}
```

Notes:

The `PushbackInputStream` wrapper class exists to enable support for forward-only streams such as `System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream`. When seeking is not supported, the `Write(...)` method can be used to write bytes to a pushback buffer. The next time the `Read(...)` method is called, bytes are read from the buffer instead of the underlying stream.


The `ReadResult<>` object contains properties that describe the read operations:
 - `Success` indicates whether the read operation succeeded
 - `Element` contains the `Integer` object if `Success` is `true`
 - `EndOfInput` indicates whether enough characters were available before the end of input
 - `Text` contains the matched text.
    - If `Success` is `false` then this is only a partial match.
 - `ErrorText` contains the mismatched text if `Success` is `false` and `EndOfInput` is `false`
